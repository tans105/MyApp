Server;

Server is built on Java techstack. The build framework is Maven. Once configured in any IDE, all the required dependenies will automatically get downloaded.

For example 

- Import the project on Eclipse IDE as Maven Project.

Tomcat needs to be installed for deploying the application.

Client: 

Angluar based application. All the dependenies are provided in the package. The application can deployed in any server. I ran the application on the Intellij provided local server.


Few points: 

1. The database connectivity could not be possible due to shortage of time. Database connectivity would require installation of postgres/mysql server that would have easily consumed 30-45 min. Instead the data is being fetched from the local file.
